# Tests Folder - Quality Assurance and Validation

This folder contains automated tests that ensure the Rwanda AI Curriculum RAG system works correctly, reliably, and safely.

## What This Folder Does

This is the **"quality control department"** that:
- **Verifies Functionality** - Ensures all features work as designed
- **Prevents Regressions** - Catches when changes break existing features
- **Validates Educational Quality** - Confirms AI responses are pedagogically sound
- **Tests Performance** - Ensures system handles expected load
- **Ensures Safety** - Validates appropriate content for educational settings

Think of tests as the "quality inspectors" that check every part of the system before students and teachers use it.

- Educational quality tests validate AI response appropriateness

**Test Documentation**:
- Each test clearly explains what it validates
- Test failures provide helpful debugging information
- Test coverage reports show which parts need more testing
- Educational rationale documented for quality tests

### Running Tests

**Development Testing**:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_rag.py

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- Tests must pass before code can be deployed
- Educational quality tests reviewed by education experts
- Performance tests validate system can handle expected usage
- Security tests ensure student data is protected

This testing folder ensures that the Rwanda AI Curriculum RAG system is not just technically sound, but educationally excellent and culturally appropriate!
