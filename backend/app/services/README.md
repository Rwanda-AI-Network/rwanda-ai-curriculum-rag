# Services Folder - Core Business Logic

This folder contains the core business logic services that power the main features of the Rwanda AI Curriculum RAG system.

## What This Folder Does

This is the **"business engine"** of the system that:
- **Orchestrates Complex Operations** - Combines multiple components into complete features
- **Implements Core Logic** - The "smart" parts that make the system intelligent
- **Manages Data Flow** - Controls how information moves through the system
- **Provides High-Level APIs** - Clean interfaces for other parts of the system
- **Handles Business Rules** - Educational policies, user permissions, content guidelines

Think of services as the "skilled specialists" that know how to perform complex educational tasks.

- Simplified language: "Plants make their own food using sunlight"
- Local example: "Like how cassava plants in your garden use sunlight to grow"
- Follow-up question: "What do you think plants need besides sunlight?"
- Related activity: "Let's observe plants in sunlight vs shade"
```

### memory.py - Context and Memory Management
**Purpose**: Manage conversation history, learning progress, and contextual understanding

**What It Does**:
- **Conversation Memory** - Remember what was discussed in previous chat sessions
- **Learning Context** - Track student progress, strengths, and areas for improvement
- **Contextual Continuity** - Maintain coherent conversations across multiple interactions
- **Personalization Data** - Store user preferences, learning goals, and customizations
- **Adaptive Behavior** - Adjust system behavior based on accumulated user interactions

**Key Features**:

- **Long-Term Memory** - Remember user interactions across multiple sessions
- **Learning Analytics** - Identify patterns in student learning and engagement
- **Context Compression** - Efficiently store and retrieve relevant conversation history
- **Privacy Protection** - Secure handling of personal learning data

**Memory System Examples**:
```
Session Memory:
- "Student asked about photosynthesis 10 minutes ago"
- "Currently working on biology topics for S2 level"
- "Student prefers visual explanations with diagrams"

Long-Term Memory:
- "Student struggles with mathematical word problems"
- "Strong performance in history and social studies"
- "Prefers Kinyarwanda explanations for complex concepts"
- "Most active during afternoon study sessions"
```

## For Contributors

### Implementation Status
This services system is **strategically architected** with:

‚úÖ **Complete Service Interfaces** - Clear contracts for each major service
üß† **AI Integration Points** - Ready for connecting various AI models
üéì **Educational Focus** - Designed specifically for learning contexts
‚ö° **Performance Optimized** - Efficient processing for real-time interactions
üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Guides** - Detailed instructions in each service file

### Getting Started
1. **Start with `response.py`** - Basic response formatting and delivery
2. **Implement `memory.py`** - Context and conversation management
3. **Build `rag.py`** - The core RAG intelligence (most complex)
4. **Test integration** - Verify services work together seamlessly
5. **Optimize performance** - Ensure fast response times for users

### Service Integration Patterns

**Typical Request Flow**:
```
1. User sends question via API
2. memory.py retrieves relevant conversation context
3. rag.py finds relevant curriculum content
4. rag.py generates AI response using content and context
5. response.py formats response for user's grade/language/preferences
6. memory.py saves interaction for future context
7. Formatted response delivered to user
```

**Service Collaboration Example**:
```python
# How services work together
async def handle_student_question(question, user_id, session_id):
    # Get conversation context
    context = await memory_service.get_context(user_id, session_id)
    
    # Find relevant content and generate response
    rag_response = await rag_service.generate_response(
        question=question,
        context=context,
        user_profile=context.user_profile
    )
    
    # Format response appropriately
    formatted_response = await response_service.format_for_user(
        response=rag_response,
        user_profile=context.user_profile,
        conversation_context=context
    )
    
    # Save interaction for future context
    await memory_service.store_interaction(
        user_id=user_id,
        question=question,
        response=formatted_response,
        session_id=session_id
    )
    
    return formatted_response
```
