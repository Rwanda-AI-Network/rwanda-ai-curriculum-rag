# App Folder - Main Application Code

This folder contains the core application code for the Rwanda AI Curriculum RAG system.

## What This Folder Does

This is where all the main application logic lives. Think of it as the "brain" of the system that handles:
- **API requests** from web or mobile apps
- **AI processing** for educational content
- **Database operations** for storing and retrieving data
- **User authentication** and permissions
- **Content management** for curriculum materials

## Key Components Explained

### main.py - Application Entry Point
- **Starts the entire system** when you run the backend
- **Configures all settings** and middleware
- **Sets up API routes** so external apps can communicate
- **Handles errors** and logging across the system
- **Manages application lifecycle** (startup and shutdown)

### api/ - External Interface
Contains all the endpoints that web/mobile apps can call:
- **auth/** - User login, registration, password management
- **curriculum/** - Upload, manage, and organize curriculum documents
- **quiz/** - Generate and manage AI-powered quizzes
- **search/** - Search through curriculum content intelligently
- **chat/** - Conversational AI for educational assistance
- **admin/** - System management and monitoring tools

### services/ - Core Business Logic  
The main processing engines:
- **rag.py** - Retrieval Augmented Generation (AI that finds and uses relevant content)
- **response.py** - Formats AI responses appropriately for users
- **memory.py** - Manages conversation history and context

### Other Important Folders
- **config/** - Manages settings for different environments (development, production)
- **data_loader/** - Handles importing curriculum from various file formats
- **embeddings/** - Converts text into AI-understandable vector representations
- **models/** - AI model management and inference processing
- **prompts/** - Template messages for different AI tasks

## For Contributors

### Implementation Status
This folder contains **skeleton code** with comprehensive implementation guides:

âœ… **Fully Mapped Out** - Every major component is planned and documented
ðŸ”¨ **Mock Classes Provided** - System runs during development
ðŸ“š **Implementation Guides** - Detailed comments explain what to build
ðŸ§ª **Tests Available** - Validation for your implementations

### Where to Start
1. **Pick any component** - they're designed to work independently
2. **Read the implementation guides** in each file
3. **Replace mock classes** with real functionality
4. **Use the tests** to validate your work
5. **Follow the TODO comments** for step-by-step guidance

### Key Features You'll Implement
- **AI-powered content processing** using vector embeddings
- **Intelligent quiz generation** from curriculum materials  
- **Conversational AI** with educational context awareness
- **Multi-language support** (English and Kinyarwanda)
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **Real-time chat** with WebSocket connections
