# Prompts Folder - AI Instruction Templates

This folder contains carefully crafted prompt templates that guide AI models to generate high-quality educational content for the Rwanda AI Curriculum RAG system.

## What This Folder Does

This is the **"AI instruction manual"** that:
- **Guides AI Behavior** - Tell AI models exactly how to respond in educational contexts
- **Ensures Consistency** - Standardize AI responses across different features
- **Maintains Quality** - Use proven prompt patterns for best results
- **Cultural Adaptation** - Include Rwanda-specific context and examples
- **Educational Focus** - Optimize for learning and teaching scenarios

Think of prompts as the "scripts" that tell AI how to be an excellent teacher or tutor.

## For Contributors

### Implementation Status
This prompt system is **expertly designed** with:

‚úÖ **Educational Best Practices** - Based on proven teaching methods
üá∑üáº **Rwanda-Specific Context** - Culturally appropriate examples and references
üéì **Pedagogically Sound** - Aligned with learning science principles
üìö **Comprehensive Coverage** - Prompts for all major educational interactions
üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Guides** - Clear examples and usage instructions

### Getting Started
1. **Start with `learning_prompts.py`** - Basic educational interaction templates
2. **Add `quiz_prompts.py`** - Assessment generation prompts
3. **Implement `utils.py`** - Prompt management tools
4. **Test with AI models** - Verify prompts produce good educational content
5. **Refine based on results** - Improve prompts based on AI outputs

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**Clear Instructions**:
```python
# Good prompt - specific and clear
"You are a friendly math tutor helping a Primary 4 student in Rwanda. 
Explain multiplication using examples of counting banana bunches or groups of students."

# Poor prompt - vague and general  
"Help with math."
```

**Educational Structure**:
```python
# Include pedagogical elements
EXPLANATION_TEMPLATE = """
1. Start with what the student already knows
2. Introduce the new concept with a simple definition
3. Provide a concrete example from Rwandan context
4. Check for understanding with a question
5. Offer practice opportunity
"""
```

**Cultural Sensitivity**:
```python
# Rwanda-appropriate examples
EXAMPLES = {
    "counting": "counting cows, banana plants, or students",
    "fractions": "sharing ubwoba (porridge) or dividing land",
    "geography": "rivers like Nyabarongo, mountains like Nyiragongo"
}
```

### Real-World Usage Examples

**Adaptive Learning Chat**:
```
Prompt: "Student asks about photosynthesis but seems confused. 
Previous responses suggest they understand plants need water and sunlight 
but struggle with the chemical process. Use agricultural examples from Rwanda..."

AI Response: "Think about the sweet potato plants you see growing. 
They take in water through their roots and sunlight through their leaves, 
just like we learned. But here's the amazing part - inside the leaves, 
the plant is actually making its own food..."
```

**Quiz Generation**:
```  
Prompt: "Generate 5 questions about Rwanda's geography for Senior 2 students. 
Include one map-reading question, one about climate, one about natural resources, 
one comparison question, and one application question..."

AI Output: Multiple relevant, well-structured questions with appropriate 
difficulty and local context.
```
