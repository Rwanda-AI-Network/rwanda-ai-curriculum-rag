if content_analysis["difficulty"]["grade_level"] > 4:
    suggestions = suggest_simplification(content_analysis)
    
# Find related content
similar_content = find_similar_documents(
    content_analysis["concepts"],
    curriculum_database
)
```

**System Performance Monitoring**:
```python
# Track system performance
performance_metrics = benchmark_system_performance(
    recent_response_times,
